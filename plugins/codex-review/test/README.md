# codex-review tests

Test suite for the `codex-review` plugin. All tests target the production
scripts under `plugins/codex-review/skills/codex-review/scripts/` — there are
no separate test copies.

Run everything from the repository root.

## test-auto-approve-plan.sh

Unit tests for `scripts/auto-approve-plan.sh` — the `PreToolUse` hook that
gates `ExitPlanMode` on the stored verdict.

Covers:

- `AUTO_REVIEW` unset / `false` / `true` / quoted / `export` / leading whitespace
- cold-start deny (no `verdict.txt`)
- `APPROVED` → allow + `verdict.txt` deletion
- `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → deny with resubmit instruction
- stale-verdict guard (second call after allow must deny)
- verdict sanitization (quotes, backslashes, all-garbage, empty) → valid JSON
- `plugin.json` hook commands must use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, not relative paths

No external binaries required (uses `python3` or `jq` for JSON validation;
skips that assertion if neither is available).

Run:

```sh
sh plugins/codex-review/test/test-auto-approve-plan.sh
```

## test-integration.sh

Path-contract tests. Catches drift between where `codex-state.sh dir`
(via `common.sh`) computes the state directory and where the standalone
POSIX `auto-approve-plan.sh` hook looks for `verdict.txt`. A mismatch
would make auto-approve silently stop working.

Scenarios:

1. Basic `main` branch with a commit.
2. Slashed branch name (`feat/my-feature` → `feat-my-feature`).
3. Fresh repo without commits — both sides must use `symbolic-ref`
   (regression: `rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns `HEAD` here).
4. Git worktree — state dir must resolve to the MAIN repo
   (via `--git-common-dir`), not the worktree.

Does **not** require the `codex` binary.

Run:

```sh
sh plugins/codex-review/test/test-integration.sh
```

## test-e2e.sh

Opt-in end-to-end tests that exercise real `codex` / `claude` CLIs.
Guarded by `CODEX_E2E=1` so CI and casual runs don't burn quota —
without the env var the script exits 0 with a skip message.

Prerequisites:

- `codex` binary in `PATH`, authenticated — always required
- `claude` binary in `PATH`, authenticated — only for the `stale` scenario
- Network access

Scenarios (selectable by name):

| name      | cost                              | what it tests |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|---------------|
| `approve` | ~2 codex calls                    | init + approve cycle, hook allow, `verdict.txt` cleanup, stale guard on second call |
| `reject`  | ~3 codex calls                    | init + reject, hook deny w/ resubmit message, resubmit in same session → APPROVED |
| `stale`   | 1 real `claude` run + ~2 codex    | stale `.codex-review/<branch>/` artifacts from a prior task must be archived by `init` — must NOT silently auto-approve the new task |

Total for all scenarios: ~5 codex calls + 1 claude run, roughly 3–5 minutes.

The `stale` scenario invokes `claude -p --plugin-dir ...` with a
5-minute hard timeout. It intentionally does not assert the new plan
review completed — only that stale `state.json` / `verdict.txt` / notes
were moved into `.codex-review/archive/<ts>/` by `archive_previous_session`
in `common.sh`. See the comment block above `scenario_stale` in
`test-e2e.sh` for the rationale on why the production hook itself cannot
be exercised from a `-p` session.

Run:

```sh
# all scenarios
CODEX_E2E=1 sh plugins/codex-review/test/test-e2e.sh

# a subset
CODEX_E2E=1 sh plugins/codex-review/test/test-e2e.sh approve
CODEX_E2E=1 sh plugins/codex-review/test/test-e2e.sh approve reject
CODEX_E2E=1 sh plugins/codex-review/test/test-e2e.sh stale
```

## Fixtures

`test-fixtures/*.md` are plan-mode inputs fed to `codex-review.sh plan
--plan-file <fixture>` by the e2e scenarios:

- **`approve_plan.md`** — trivial "do nothing" plan; Codex should return
  `APPROVED`.
- **`reject_plan.md`** — explicitly instructs Codex to respond
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED`. Used to exercise the reject path.
- **`resubmit_plan.md`** — follow-up plan in the **same** Codex session
  that explicitly acknowledges the transition from the reject test and
  asks for `APPROVED`. A plain `approve_plan.md` would not work here
  because the earlier `reject_plan.md` instruction "sticks" in the
  session and keeps producing `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.

## Exit codes

All three scripts exit `0` on success and `1` if any assertion failed.
`test-e2e.sh` additionally exits `0` (skip) when `CODEX_E2E` is not set.
